Car Price Prediction Data Analysis

Car Price Prediction

Project

This dataset contains 10,000 entries created for the purpose of predicting car prices. Each row represents information about a car and its price.

---

Dataset:

Make: Specifies the make of the car (e.g. Toyota, BMW, Ford).

Example values: "Toyota", "BMW", "Mercedes".

Model: Specifies the model of the car (e.g. Corolla, Focus, X5).

Example values: "Corolla", "Focus", "X5".

Year: The year the car was produced. Newer years generally indicate higher prices. Example values: 2005, 2018, 2023.

Engine_Size: Specifies the engine size in liters (L). Larger engines generally correlate with higher prices.

Example values: 1.6, 2.0, 3.5.

Fuel_Type: Indicates the type of fuel used by the car:
Gasoline: Cars that run on gasoline.
Diesel: Cars that run on diesel fuel.
Hybrid: Cars that run on both gasoline and electricity.
Electric: All-electric cars.

Transmission: The type of transmission in the car:
Manual: Manual transmission.
Automatic: Automatic transmission.
Semi-Automatic: Semi-automatic transmission.

Mileage: The total distance traveled by the car, measured in kilometers. Lower mileage generally indicates a higher price.

Example values: 15,000, 75,000, 230,000.

Doors: The number of doors on the car. Typically 2, 3, 4, or 5 doors.

Example values: 2, 3, 4, 5.

Owner_Count: The number of previous owners of the car. Fewer owners usually indicate a higher price.

Example values: 1, 2, 3, 4.

Price: The estimated selling price of the car. It is calculated based on several factors, such as year of production, engine size, mileage, fuel type, and transmission.

Example values: 5,000, 15,000, 30,000.
